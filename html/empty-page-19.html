Buyer and Seller will receive Escrow Holder's general provisions, if any, directly from Escrow Holder. To the extent the general<br>provisions are inconsistent or conflict with this Agreement, the general provisions will control as to the duties and obligations of<br>Escrow Holder only. Buyer and Seller shall Sign and return Escrow Holder's general provisions or supplemental instructions<br>within the time specified in paragraph 3N(2). Buyer and Seller shall execute additional instructions, documents and forms<br>provided by Escrow Holder that are reasonably necessary to close the escrow and, as directed by Escrow Holder, within 3<br>Days, shall pay to Escrow Holder or HOA or HOA management company or others any fee required by paragraphs 3, 8, 10,<br>11, or elsewhere in this Agreement.<br>C.

Buyer and Seller authorize Escrow Holder to accept and rely on Copies and Signatures as defined in this<br>Agreement as originals, to open escrow and for other purposes of escrow. The validity of this Agreement as between Buyer<br>and Seller is not affected by whether or when Escrow Holder Signs this Agreement. Escrow Holder shall provide Seller's<br>Statement of Information to Title Company when received from Seller, if a separate company is providing title insurance. If<br>Seller delivers an affidavit to Escrow Holder to satisfy Seller's FIRPTA obligation under paragraph 11H, Escrow Holder shall<br>deliver to Buyer, Buyer's Agent, and Seller's Agent a Qualified Substitute statement that complies with federal Law. If Escrow<br>Holder's Qualified Substitute statement does not comply with federal law, the Parties instruct escrow to withhold all applicable<br>required amounts under paragraph 11H.<br>D. Agents are not a party to the escrow, except for Brokers for the sole purpose of compensation pursuant to paragraph 18A and<br>paragraph 3 of the Real Estate Brokers Section. If a Copy of the separate compensation agreement(s) provided for in either of<br>those paragraphs is deposited with Escrow Holder by Agent, Escrow Holder shall accept such agreement(s) and pay out from<br>Buyer's or Seller's funds, or both, as applicable, the Broker's compensation provided for in such agreement(s). Buyer and Seller<br>irrevocably assign to Brokers compensation specified in paragraph 18A, and irrevocably instruct Escrow Holder to disburse those<br>funds to Brokers at Close Of Escrow or pursuant to any other mutually executed cancellation agreement. Compensation instructions<br>can be amended or revoked only with the written consent of Brokers. Buyer and Seller shall release and hold harmless Escrow<br>Holder from any liability resulting from Escrow Holder's payment to Broker(s) of compensation pursuant to this Agreement.<br>E. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Escrow Holder may require invoices for expenses under this Agreement. Buyer and Seller,<br>upon request by Escrow Holder, within 3 Days or within a sufficient time to close escrow, whichever is sooner, shall provide<br>any such invoices to Escrow Holder.<br>F. Upon receipt, Escrow Holder shall provide Buyer, Seller, and each Agent verification of Buyer's deposit of funds pursuant to<br>paragraphs 5A(1) and 5A(2). Once Escrow Holder becomes aware of any of the following, Escrow Holder shall immediately<br>notify each Agent: (i) if Buyer's initial or any additional deposit or down payment is not made pursuant to this Agreement, or is<br>not good at time of deposit with Escrow Holder; or (ii) if Buyer and Seller instruct Escrow Holder to cancel escrow.<br>G. A Copy of any amendment that affects any paragraph of this Agreement for which Escrow Holder is responsible shall be<br>delivered to Escrow Holder within 3 Days after mutual execution of the amendment.</p>
