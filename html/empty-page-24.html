<br><p id='499' style='font-size:18px'>1. IMPORTANCE OF PROPERTY INVESTIGATION: The physical condition of the land and improvements being<br>purchased is not guaranteed by either Seller or Brokers. You have an affirmative duty to exercise reasonable care to<br>protect yourself, including discovery of the legal, practical and technical implications of disclosed facts, and the<br>investigation and verification of information and facts that you know or that are within your diligent attention and<br>observation. A general physical inspection typically does not cover all aspects of the Property nor items affecting the<br>Property that are not physically located on the Property. If the professionals recommend further investigations,<br>including a recommendation by a pest control operator to inspect inaccessible areas of the Property, you should<br>contact qualified experts to conduct such additional investigations.<br>2. BROKER OBLIGATIONS: Brokers do not have expertise in all areas and therefore cannot advise you on many items,<br>such as those listed below. If Broker gives you referrals to professionals, Broker does not guarantee their<br>performance.<br>3. YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO INVESTIGATE THE CONDITION AND SUITABILITY OF ALL ASPECTS OF THE<br>PROPERTY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING. IF YOU DO NOT DO SO, YOU ARE ACTING<br>AGAINST THE ADVICE OF BROKERS.</p>

SQUARE FOOTAGE, AGE, BOUNDARIES: Square footage, room dimensions, lot size, age of improvements<br>and boundaries.

EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODING: Susceptibility of the Property to earthquake/seismic hazards and propensity<br>of the Property to flood.<br>H. FIRE, HAZARD, AND OTHER INSURANCE: The availability and cost of necessary or desired insurance may vary.<br>The location of the Property in a seismic, flood or fire hazard zone, and other conditions, such as the age of the<br>Property and the claims history of the Property and Buyer, may affect the availability and need for certain types of<br>insurance. Buyer should explore insurance options early as this information may affect other decisions, including the<br>removal of loan and inspection contingencies.<br>1.

RENTAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS: The State, some counties, and some cities impose restrictions that limit the<br>amount of rent that can be charged, the maximum number of occupants, and the right of a landlord to terminate a<br>tenancy. Deadbolt or other locks and security systems for doors and windows, including window bars, should be<br>examined to determine whether they satisfy legal requirements.<br>K. SECURITY AND SAFETY: State and local Law may require the installation of barriers, access alarms, self-<br>latching mechanisms and/or other measures to decrease the risk to children and other persons of existing<br>swimming pools and hot tubs, as well as various fire safety and other measures concerning other features of the<br>Property.</p>
