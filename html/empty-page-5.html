<br><p id='109' style='font-size:18px'>(C.A.R. Form PRBS, Revised 12/21)</p>
<p id='110' style='font-size:20px'>A real estate broker (Broker), whether a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship, may represent more than one buyer<br>or seller. This multiple representation can occur through an individual licensed as a broker or salesperson or through different<br>individual broker's or salespersons (associate licensees) acting under the Broker's license. The associate licensees may be<br>working out of the same or different office locations.</p>
<br><p id='111' style='font-size:20px'>Multiple Buyers: Broker (individually or through its associate licensees) may be working with many prospective buyers at<br>the same time. These prospective buyers may have an interest in, and make offers on, the same properties. Some of these<br>properties may be listed with Broker and some may not. Broker will not limit or restrict any particular buyer from making<br>an offer on any particular property whether or not Broker represents other buyers interested in the same property.</p>
<br><p id='112' style='font-size:20px'>Multiple Sellers: Broker (individually or through its associate licensees) may have listings on many properties at the same<br>time. As a result, Broker will attempt to find buyers for each of those listed properties. Some listed properties may appeal to<br>the same prospective buyers. Some properties may attract more prospective buyers than others. Some of these prospective<br>buyers may be represented by Broker and some may not. Broker will market all listed properties to all prospective buyers<br>whether or not Broker has another or other listed properties that may appeal to the same prospective buyers.</p>
<br><p id='113' style='font-size:22px'>Dual Agency: If Seller is represented by Broker, Seller acknowledges that broker may represent prospective buyers<br>of Seller's property and consents to Broker acting as a dual agent for both seller and buyer in that transaction. If Buyer<br>is represented by Broker, buyer acknowledges that Broker may represent sellers of property that Buyer is interested in<br>acquiring and consents to Broker acting as a dual agent for both buyer and seller with regard to that property.</p>
<br><p id='114' style='font-size:22px'>In the event of dual agency, seller and buyer agree that: a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the<br>respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the<br>buyer's or seller's financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact price,<br>including the seller's willingness to accept a price less than the listing price or the buyer's willingness to pay a price<br>greater than the price offered; and except as set forth above, a dual agent is obligated to disclose known facts materially<br>affecting the value or desirability of the Property to both parties.</p>
<br><p id='115' style='font-size:22px'>Offers not necessarily confidential: Buyer is advised that seller or listing agent may disclose the existence, terms, or<br>conditions of buyer's offer unless all parties and their agent have signed a written confidentiality agreement. Whether any such<br>information is actually disclosed depends on many factors, such as current market conditions, the prevailing practice in the real<br>estate community, the listing agent's marketing strategy and the instructions of the seller.</p>
<br><p id='116' style='font-size:20px'>Buyer and seller understand that Broker may represent more than one buyer or more than one seller and even both buyer<br>and seller on the same transaction and consents to such relationships.</p>
