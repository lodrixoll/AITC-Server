<p id='161' style='font-size:20px'>1. IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING PROPERTY INSURANCE: If the property you are purchasing is destroyed or damaged<br>due to natural disaster or accident or some other event, insurance may be available to help with the cost of repair or<br>rebuilding. In the absence of property insurance, the homeowner would be responsible for the full expense. If the property<br>is purchased with a loan, or refinanced, the lender will require an insurance policy protecting its interest. Insurance<br>policies can cover damage due to one or more of the following: fire, flood, earthquake and other causes. The policy or<br>an insurance broker should be consulted to determine when coverage applies and whether a supplement or rider can be<br>purchased to provide additional coverage or if a separate policy is necessary.<br>2. PROPERTY INSURANCE AND PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS: Your real estate purchase contract may contain a<br>contingency that gives you the right to legally cancel the agreement within a specified time if you are unable to obtain or<br>afford property insurance. This cancellation right may be part of an overall investigation contingency or may be a specific<br>contingency pertaining to insurance. If buyer waives or removes the applicable contingency before determining the<br>availability and cost of property insurance, buyer is acting against the advice of broker.<br>3. CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET: Some insurance carriers in California have stopped issuing new<br>property insurance policies and others are limiting the number and location of new policies. These changes may affect<br>both the availability and cost of insurance. However, over 50 insurance carriers are admitted to sell property insurance in<br>California so it may be possible to obtain insurance even if some carriers will not write a new policy covering the property<br>you intend to buy. An insurance broker may also be able to find a non-admitted insurance carrier offering to insure<br>the property you intend to buy. Because locating an affordable insurance policy could take time and effort, buyers are<br>advised to make all insurance inquiries as early in the home buying process as possible.<br>4. INSURANCE CONDITIONS: Many insurance carriers impose physical condition standards before issuing a policy, or<br>reserve the right to cancel policies even after they are issued, if certain minimum standards are not confirmed in an<br>inspection or otherwise. Physical conditions standards could include, but are not limited to, prohibition of "knob and tube"<br>electrical wiring, requirements related to piping/plumbing materials, standards related to the age and/or quality of the roof<br>or foundation, minimal safety standards related to handrails, tripping hazards, and defensible space requirements.<br>5. RESOURCES: The California Department of Insurance (DOI) maintains a website addressing Residential Home<br>insurance. Resources on this State government webpage include: (i) Top Ten tips for Finding Residential Insurance;<br>(ii) Residential Insurance Company Contact List; (iii) Home Insurance Finder; and (iv) information on other insurance<br>issues. The webpage also includes information on how to contact the DOI, and suggestions on what to do if you cannot<br>find insurance. The webpage and link to other documents is located at https://www.insurance.gov0t-consumers/i 05-<br>type/5-residential/index.cfm.<br>6. BROKER RECOMMENDATION: Buyer is advised to explore available property insurance options early in the home<br>buying process and to consult with a qualified insurance professional of buyer's choosing to understand insurance<br>availability and cost prior to removal of any related contingencies. Real estate brokers do not have expertise in this area.</p>
