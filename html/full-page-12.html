<br><p id='252' style='font-size:16px'>C. BUYER STATED FINANCING: Seller is relying on Buyer's representation of the type of financing specified (including, but not<br>limited to, as applicable, all cash, amount of down payment, or contingent or non-contingent loan). Seller has agreed to a specific<br>closing date, purchase price, and to sell to Buyer in reliance on Buyer's specified financing. Buyer shall pursue the financing<br>specified in this Agreement, even if Buyer also elects to pursue an alternative form of financing. Seller has no obligation to<br>cooperate with Buyer's efforts to obtain any financing other than that specified in this Agreement but shall not interfere with closing<br>at the purchase price on the COE date (paragraph 3B) even if based upon alternate financing. Buyer's inability to obtain alternate<br>financing does not excuse Buyer from the obligation to purchase the Property and close escrow as specified in this Agreement.</p>

<br><p id='254' style='font-size:16px'>A. OCCUPANCY: If Buyer intends to occupy as a primary or secondary residence (see paragraph 3E(3)), and unless Otherwise<br>Agreed, such as in C.A.R.

Form TOPA in a counter offer if not part of Buyer's offer.<br>B. CONDITION OF PROPERTY ON CLOSING:</p>
<br><p id='255' style='font-size:16px'>(1) Unless Otherwise Agreed: (i) the Property shall be delivered "As-Is" in its PRESENT physical condition as of the date of<br>Acceptance; (ii) the Property, including pool, spa, landscaping and grounds, is to be maintained in substantially the same<br>condition as on the date of Acceptance; and (iii) all debris and personal property not included in the sale shall be removed<br>by Close Of Escrow or at the time possession is delivered to Buyer, if not on the same date. If items are not removed<br>when possession is delivered to Buyer, all items shall be deemed abandoned. Buyer, after first Delivering to Seller written<br>notice to remove the items within 3 Days, may pay to have such items removed or disposed of and may bring legal action,<br>as per this Agreement, to receive reasonable costs from Seller.<br>(2) Buyer is strongly advised to conduct investigations of the entire Property in order to determine its present<br>condition. Seller and Agents may not be aware of all defects affecting the Property or other factors that Buyer<br>considers important. Property improvements may not be built according to code, in compliance with current<br>Law, or have had all required permits issued and/or finalized.<br>C. SELLER REMAINING IN POSSESSION AFTER CLOSE OF ESCROW: If Seller has the right to remain in possession after<br>Close Of Escrow pursuant to paragraph 3M(2) or as Otherwise Agreed: The Parties are advised to (i) consult with their<br>insurance and legal advisors for information about liability and damage or injury to persons and personal and real property;<br>and (ii) consult with a qualified California real estate attorney where the Property is located to determine the ongoing rights<br>and responsibilities of both Buyer and Seller with regard to each other, including possible tenant rights, and what type of<br>written agreement to use to document the relationship between the Parties. Buyer is advised to consult with Buyer's lender<br>about the impact of Seller's occupancy on Buyer's loan.<br>D. At Close Of Escrow: (i) Seller assigns to Buyer any assignable warranty rights for items included in the sale; and (ii) Seller shall<br>Deliver to Buyer available Copies of any such warranties. Agents cannot and will not determine the assignability of any warranties.<br>E. Seller shall, on Close Of Escrow unless Otherwise Agreed and even if Seller remains in possession, provide keys, passwords,<br>codes and/or means to operate all locks, mailboxes, security systems, alarms, home automation systems, intranet and<br>Internet-connected devices included in the purchase price, garage door openers, and all items included in either paragraph 3P<br>or paragraph 9. If the Property is a condominium or located in a common interest development, Seller shall be responsible for<br>securing or providing any such items for Association amenities, facilities, and access. Buyer may be required to pay a deposit<br>to the Homeowners' Association ("HOA") to obtain keys to accessible HOA facilities.</p>
<br><p id='256' style='font-size:16px'>8. CONTINGENCIES AND REMOVAL OF CONTINGENCIES:</p>
<br><p id='257' style='font-size:22px'>A. LOAN(S):</p>
<br><p id='258' style='font-size:18px'>(1) This Agreement is, unless otherwise specified in paragraph 3L(1) or an attached CR-B form, contingent upon Buyer<br>obtaining the loan(s) specified. If contingent, Buyer shall act diligently and in good faith to obtain the designated loan(s). If<br>there is no appraisal contingency or the appraisal contingency has been waived or removed, then failure of the<br>Property to appraise at the purchase price does not entitle Buyer to exercise the cancellation right pursuant to<br>the loan contingency if Buyer is otherwise qualified for the specified loan and Buyer is able to satisfy lender's<br>non-appraisal conditions for closing the loan.<br>(2) Buyer is advised to investigate the insurability of the Property as early as possible, as this may be a requirement for<br>lending. Buyer's ability to obtain insurance for the Property, including fire insurance, is part of Buyer's Investigation of<br>Property contingency. Failure of Buyer to obtain insurance may justify cancellation based on the Investigation contingency<br>but not the loan contingency.<br>(3) Buyer's contractual obligations regarding deposit, balance of down payment and closing costs are not contingencies of<br>this Agreement, unless Otherwise Agreed.<br>(4) If there is an appraisal contingency, removal of the loan contingency shall not be deemed removal of the appraisal contingency.<br>(5) NO LOAN CONTINGENCY: If "No loan contingency" is checked in paragraph 3L(1), obtaining any loan specified is NOT<br>a contingency of this Agreement. If Buyer does not obtain the loan specified, and as a result is unable to purchase the<br>Property, Seller may be entitled to Buyer's deposit or other legal remedies.</p>
<br><p id='259' style='font-size:16px'>B. APPRAISAL:</p>
<br><p id='260' style='font-size:16px'>(1) This Agreement is, unless otherwise specified in paragraph 3L(2) or an attached CR-B form, contingent upon a<br>written appraisal of the Property by a licensed or certified appraiser at no less than the amount specified in paragraph<br>3L(2), without requiring repairs or improvements to the Property. Appraisals are often a reliable source to verify square<br>footage of the subject Property. However, the ability to cancel based on the measurements provided in an appraisal falls<br>within the Investigation of Property contingency. The appraisal contingency is solely limited to the value determined by the<br>appraisal. For any cancellation based upon this appraisal contingency, Buyer shall Deliver a Copy of the written appraisal<br>to Seller, upon request by Seller.<br>(2) NO APPRAISAL CONTINGENCY: If "No appraisal contingency" is checked in paragraph 3L(2), then Buyer may not use<br>the loan contingency specified in paragraph 3L(1) to cancel this Agreement if the sole reason for not obtaining the loan is<br>that the appraisal relied upon by Buyer's lender values the property at an amount less than that specified in paragraph<br>3L(2). If Buyer is unable to obtain the loan specified solely for this reason, Seller may be entitled to Buyer's deposit or<br>other legal remedies.<br>(3) X Fair Appraisal Act: The Parties acknowledge receipt of the attached Fair Appraisal Act Addendum (C.A.R. Form FAAA).</p>
<br><p id='261' style='font-size:18px'>C. INVESTIGATION OF PROPERTY: This Agreement is, as specified in paragraph 3L(3), contingent upon Buyer's acceptance<br>of the condition of, and any other matter affecting, the Property. See paragraph 12.</p>
<br><p id='262' style='font-size:18px'>D. REVIEW OF SELLER DOCUMENTS: This Agreement is, as specified in paragraph 3L(4), contingent upon Buyer's review<br>and approval of Seller's documents required in paragraph 14A.</p>
