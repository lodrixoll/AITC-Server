<br><p id='554' style='font-size:20px'>(C.A.R. Form CCPA, Revised 12/22)</p>
<p id='555' style='font-size:22px'>The California Consumer Privacy Act (commencing with Civil Code § 1798. 100) ("CCPA"), as amended by California voters<br>in 2020, grants to California residents certain rights in their private, personal information ("PI") that is collected by companies<br>with whom they do business. Under the CCPA, PI is defined broadly to encompass non-public records information that could<br>reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you. PI could potentially include photographs of, or sales information about, your<br>property.</p>
<p id='556' style='font-size:20px'>During the process of buying and selling real estate your PI will be collected and likely shared with others, including real<br>estate licensees, a Multiple Listing Service, real estate internet websites, service providers, lenders, and title and escrow<br>companies, to name several possibilities. Businesses that are covered by the CCPA are required to grant you various rights<br>in your PI, including the right to know what PI is collected, the right to know what PI is sold or shared and to whom, the right<br>to request that the business correct or delete your PI, the right to "opt out" or stop the transfer of your PI to others, and the<br>right to limit the use of certain PI which is considered "sensitive." You may get one or more notices regarding your CCPA<br>rights from businesses you interact with in a real estate transaction. However, not all businesses that receive or share your<br>PI are obligated to comply with the CCPA. Moreover, businesses that are otherwise covered under the CCPA may have a<br>legal obligation to maintain PI, notwithstanding your instruction to the contrary. For instance, regardless of whether they are<br>covered by CCPA, under California law, brokers and Multiple Listing Services are required to maintain their records for 3<br>years. If you wish to exercise your rights under CCPA, where applicable, you should contact the respective business directly.</p>
<p id='557' style='font-size:22px'>You can obtain more information about the CCPA and your rights under the law from the State of California Department<br>of Justice (oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa). Additionally, the California Privacy Protection Agency is authorized to promulgate<br>regulations which may further clarify requirements of the CCPA (cppa.ca.gov/regulations/).</p>
