<br><p id='137' style='font-size:20px'>WIRE FRAUD AND ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS ADVISORY:</p>
<br><p id='138' style='font-size:18px'>The ability to communicate and conduct business electronically is a convenience and reality in nearly all parts of our lives.<br>At the same time, it has provided hackers and scammers new opportunities for their criminal activity. Many businesses<br>have been victimized and the real estate business is no exception.</p>
<br><p id='139' style='font-size:18px'>While wiring or electronically transferring funds is a welcome convenience, we all need to exercise extreme caution.<br>Emails attempting to induce fraudulent wire transfers have been received and have appeared to be legitimate. Reports<br>indicate that some hackers have been able to intercept emailed transfer instructions, obtain account information and, by<br>altering some of the data, redirect the funds to a different account. It also appears that some hackers were able to provide<br>false phone numbers for verifying the wiring or funds transfer instructions. In those cases, the victim called the number<br>provided to confirm the instructions, and then unwittingly authorized a transfer to somewhere or someone other than the<br>intended recipient.</p>
<br><p id='140' style='font-size:22px'>ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ADVISED:</p>
<br><p id='141' style='font-size:20px'>1. Obtain phone numbers and account numbers only from Escrow Officers, Property Managers, or<br>Landlords at the beginning of the transaction.<br>2. DO NOT EVER WIRE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS PRIOR TO CALLING TO<br>CONFIRM THE TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. ONLY USE A PHONE NUMBER YOU WERE<br>PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY. Do not use any different phone number or account number included<br>in any emailed transfer instructions.<br>3. Orally confirm the transfer instruction is legitimate and confirm the bank routing number,<br>account numbers and other codes before taking steps to transfer the funds.<br>4. Avoid sending personal information in emails or texts. Provide such information in person or<br>over the telephone directly to the Escrow Officer, Property Manager, or Landlord.<br>5. Take steps to secure the system you are using with your email account. These steps include<br>creating strong passwords, using secure WiFi, and not using free services.</p>
<br><p id='142' style='font-size:18px'>If you believe you have received questionable or suspicious wire or funds transfer instructions, immediately notify your<br>bank, and the other party, and the Escrow Office, Landlord, or Property Manager.
