The Preliminary Report is only an offer by the title insurer to issue a<br>policy of title insurance and may not contain every item affecting title. The company providing the Preliminary Report shall,<br>prior to issuing a Preliminary Report, conduct a search of the General Index for all Sellers except banks or other institutional<br>lenders selling properties they acquired through foreclosure (REOs), corporations, and government entities.<br>B.
